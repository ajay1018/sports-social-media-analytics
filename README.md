# 🏟️ Sports Social Media Analytics

Portfolio demo that ingests sample social posts (JSON), transforms them into engagement metrics (by team and league), and renders a small Streamlit dashboard. Runnable extract/transform with a clean DE-style structure.

---

## What this shows
- Ingestion (stubbed extract) → transformation → simple reporting
- Clear repo layout for Data Engineering work
- Quick local run with minimal dependencies

---

## Tech Stack
- Python (pandas)
- JSON/CSV (local demo data)
- Streamlit (optional dashboard)

---

## How to Run (Local)

```bash
# 1) install
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2) generate raw + processed data
python src/extract/extract_local.py
python src/transform/transform_metrics.py

# 3) open the dashboard (optional)
streamlit run dashboards/app.py

Outputs

data/processed/team_metrics.csv — engagement by team
data/processed/league_metrics.csv — engagement by league
data/processed/posts_enriched.csv — posts with engagement column
